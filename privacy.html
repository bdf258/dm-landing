        <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
        <p>
          DearMP ("we", "us", "our") provides casework management software for Members of Parliament and their offices. We are the data controller for personal data collected through our website at dearmp.uk and our application at app.dearmp.uk.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have any questions about this privacy policy or how we handle your personal data, please contact us at <a href="mailto:ben@dearmp.uk">ben@dearmp.uk</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>2. What data we collect</h2>

        <h3>Marketing website (dearmp.uk)</h3>
        <p>When you visit our marketing website, we collect minimal data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Standard server log data (IP address, browser type, pages visited, timestamps) — collected automatically by our hosting infrastructure</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Our marketing website does not use analytics tracking, advertising cookies, or third-party tracking scripts.</p>

        <h3>DearMP application (app.dearmp.uk)</h3>
        <p>When you use the DearMP application, we may collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account information</strong> — name, email address, and role within the parliamentary office</li>
          <li><strong>Casework data</strong> — constituent correspondence, case details, notes, and tags that you and your team create or import into the system</li>
          <li><strong>Constituent data</strong> — names, contact details, and other personal information relating to constituents, as provided in correspondence or entered by your team</li>
          <li><strong>Usage data</strong> — how you interact with the application, features used, and performance data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How we use your data</h2>
        <p>We use personal data for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Providing our service</strong> — to operate the DearMP application, including AI-assisted email triage, case management, and related features</li>
          <li><strong>Account management</strong> — to create and manage user accounts, authenticate users, and manage permissions</li>
          <li><strong>Service improvement</strong> — to understand how the application is used and to improve its features and performance</li>
          <li><strong>Communication</strong> — to respond to enquiries, provide support, and send service-related notifications</li>
          <li><strong>Legal compliance</strong> — to comply with our legal obligations</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Legal bases for processing</h2>
        <p>Under UK GDPR, we rely on the following legal bases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Contract</strong> — processing necessary to provide the DearMP service to you and your parliamentary office</li>
          <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> — processing necessary for our legitimate interests, such as improving our service and ensuring security, where these interests are not overridden by your rights</li>
          <li><strong>Legal obligation</strong> — processing necessary to comply with a legal obligation</li>
          <li><strong>Consent</strong> — where you have given consent to the processing, such as for optional cookies</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Who we share your data with</h2>
        <p>
          We use a limited number of third-party service providers (subprocessors) to help us operate our service. These providers process data only on our instructions and are contractually bound to protect your data.
        </p>
        <p>
          A current list of our subprocessors is available at <a href="https://subprocessors.dearmp.uk">subprocessors.dearmp.uk</a>.
        </p>
        <p>We do not sell your personal data to third parties. We do not share your data with third parties for their own marketing purposes.</p>

        <h2>6. International data transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Some of our subprocessors may process data outside the United Kingdom. Where this occurs, we ensure appropriate safeguards are in place, such as standard contractual clauses approved by the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), or the transfer is to a country that the UK has determined provides an adequate level of data protection.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide our service and fulfil the purposes described in this policy. When a parliamentary office terminates its use of DearMP, we will delete or anonymise their data within 90 days, unless we are required by law to retain it for longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Server log data from our marketing website is retained for no longer than 30 days.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
        <p>Under UK GDPR, you have the following rights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Access</strong> — you can request a copy of the personal data we hold about you</li>
          <li><strong>Rectification</strong> — you can ask us to correct inaccurate personal data</li>
          <li><strong>Erasure</strong> — you can ask us to delete your personal data in certain circumstances</li>
          <li><strong>Restriction</strong> — you can ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data</li>
          <li><strong>Portability</strong> — you can request that we transfer your personal data to another provider in a structured, commonly used format</li>
          <li><strong>Objection</strong> — you can object to the processing of your personal data where we rely on legitimate interests</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          To exercise any of these rights, please contact us at <a href="mailto:ben@dearmp.uk">ben@dearmp.uk</a>. We will respond to your request within one month.
